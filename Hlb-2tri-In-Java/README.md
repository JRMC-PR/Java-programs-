# Hlb-2tri-In-Java

This repository contains several Java programs that demonstrate basic programming concepts. Following the Hlb 2tri Python proyects in Java.

## Description

This repository contains several Java programs that demonstrate basic programming concepts such as arithmetic operations, loops, and conditional statements. Each program is contained in its own file and can be compiled and run independently.

## Usage

To use any of the programs in this repository, simply compile the Java source code and run the resulting class file. For example, to run the `add` program, you would run the following commands:

```Linux
$ javac add.java
$ java add
```

This would compile the `add.java` file and run the resulting `add.class` file, which would output the result of the `add` method to the console.

| fizzbuzz.java             | Prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".                                                                          |
| islower.java              | Defines a `public static` method called `isLower` that takes a `char` parameter and returns `true` if the character is lowercase and `false` otherwise.                                                             |
| last_digit.java           | Defines a `public static` method called `lastDigit` that takes two `int` parameters and returns `true` if the last digit of the first parameter is equal to the second parameter, and `false` otherwise.            |
| positive_or_negative.java | Defines a `public static` method called `positiveOrNegative` that takes an `int` parameter and prints "Positive" if the number is positive, "Negative" if the number is negative, and "Zero" if the number is zero. |
| pow.java                  | Defines a `public static` method called `pow` that takes two `int` parameters and returns the first parameter raised to the power of the second parameter.                                                          |
