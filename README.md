# Java Programs Repository

This repository contains several directories, each containing Java programs that demonstrate basic programming concepts.

## Directories

### Hlb-2ti-In-Java

This directory contains several Java programs that demonstrate basic programming concepts such as arithmetic operations, loops, and conditional statements following the Hlb 2tri Python proyects in Java.Each program is contained in its own file and can be compiled and run independently.

### Turabo Work

This directory contains Java programs that I have written for my Turabo University courses to demonstrate more advanced programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. Each program is contained in its own file and can be compiled and run independently.
